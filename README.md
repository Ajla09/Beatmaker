 DrumKit Project

Welcome to the README for the DrumKit project, a web application designed to simulate a drum machine using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The DrumKit project allows users to create beats by clicking on different pads, each triggering a unique sound. This project is an excellent example for learning and practicing front-end development skills, particularly focusing on event handling, audio playback, and animation in JavaScript.

 1. Drum Pads
 Clickable pads that trigger different drum sounds (kick, snare, hi-hat).
Technologies Used HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for event handling and sound playback.

2. Play Button
Controls the playback of the beat sequence.
Technologies Used: HTML button element, CSS for styling, JavaScript for play/stop functionality.

 3. Tempo Control
 Adjusts the tempo (beats per minute) of the beat sequence.
Technologies Used: HTML select element for tempo selection, JavaScript for tempo control logic.

 4. Sound Selection
Allows users to select different sound samples for each drum pad.
Technologies Used: HTML select elements for sound selection, JavaScript for handling sound changes.

 5. Beat Sequence Animation
Animates the beat sequence by highlighting active pads.
Technologies Used: CSS animations, JavaScript for controlling animation triggers.
